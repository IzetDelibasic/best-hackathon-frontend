## Overview

iTeach is an innovative application developed during the 36-hour BEST Hackathon in Mostar. Our goal was to create a platform that facilitates the creation of quick tests for preschool children using artificial intelligence technology. The frontend part of the application was developed in ReactJS with TypeScript, using Tailwind CSS for styling. The backend is implemented in .NET technology, using MySQL as the database.
